OMGF automagically caches the Google Fonts used by your theme/plugins locally. No configuration (or brains) required!

== Description ==

**OMGF can be downloaded for free without any paid subscription from [the official WordPress repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/host-webfonts-local/).**

> How could using fonts via Google's service possibly run afoul of GDPR? The fact of the matter is that, when a font is requested by the user's browser, their IP is logged by Google and used for analytics.
> â€” Lifehacker

**Leverage Browser Cache**, **reduce DNS lookups/requests**, **reduce Cumulative Layout Shift** and make your Google Fonts **100% GDPR compliant** with OMGF!

OMGF is written with performance and user-friendliness in mind. It uses the Google Fonts API to automatically cache the fonts your theme and plugins use to **minimize DNS requests** and speed up your WordPress website.

= How Does It Work? =

After installing and configuring the plugin, OMGF will automatically start looking for Google Fonts whenever a page is requested on your website.

All Google Fonts are listed in the **Optimize Local Fonts** section of OMGF's settings screen. There, you can choose to:

- *Preload* fonts to **reduce Cumulative Layout Shift** above the fold,
- *Unload* fonts that're not used by you, your theme and/or plugins,
- Set a *Fallback Font Stack* (OMGF Pro required), to further **reduce Cumulative Layout Shift**, or
- *Replace* (OMGF Pro required) font-families with system fonts to **speed up loading times**!

= Other Features include =

- The **integrated Google Fonts checker** notifies you if a plugin or your theme has added Google Fonts (e.g. after an update) it can't process.
- **Variable Fonts** support,
- Automatically **Remove unused subsets** to reduce the size of the CSS stylesheet up to 90%!
- **Remove Resource Hints** (preload, preconnect, dns-prefetch) pointing to `fonts.googleapis.com` or
  `fonts.gstatic.com`,
- **Ensure text remains visible during webfont load** by forcing the _font-display_ attribute to your Google Fonts,
- **Ensure text remains visible during webfont load** by forcing the _font-display_ attribute to all your other fonts! (
  OMGF Pro required),

= Additional Features in OMGF Pro =

- Run the **Google Fonts checker** in the frontend (for all users) to **organically check for present external Google Fonts** throughout your site.
- **Smart Preload** automatically configures which fonts should be preloaded i.e., loaded early to reduce Cumulative Layout Shift, Largest Contentful Paint and [Ensure Text Remains Visible During Webfont Load](https://daan.dev/blog/how-to/ensure-text-remains-visible-during-webfont-load/).
- Automatically configures itself to make sure all externally hosted Google Fonts on your site are hosted locally. OMGF Pro supports:
	- `@font-face` and `@import` statements inside **inline `<style>` blocks**,
	- `@font-face` and `@import` statements inside **local stylesheets** loaded by e.g. your theme and/or plugins,
	- `@font-face` and `@import` statements inside **externally hosted stylesheets** loaded by your theme and/or
	  plugins,
	- Web Font Loader (`webfont.js`),
	- Async Google Fonts (loaded using JS)
	- Material Icons.
- **Multisite** and **WPML** support.
- **Whitelabel stylesheets**, which removes branding and comments from the stylesheets to further reduce the size.
- Modify your fonts' `src: url()` attribute to fully integrate with your configuration,
	- Use this to serve fonts and the stylesheets from your CDN, or
	- To serve fonts from an alternative path (e.g. when you're using Security through Obscurity plugins like WP Hide,
	  etc.), or
	- Anything you like!
- **Developer Mode**, which allows you to easily migrate between Development, Staging/Testing, Acceptance and Production
  environments.
